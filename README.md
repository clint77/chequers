# Chequers
by Ptolemy Barnes and Clint Pijuan

Chequers is a board game played by two *players*. It is played on a *board*, 8x8 in size. A player **moves** her *pieces* across the board with the objective of
**taking** the pieces of the opponent player. Pieces can initially only move diagonally toward the opponent's side. The game is **over** when all of a player's pieces have been taken.

#### Special rules:
  - A player also loses when there is no valid move that he or she can make.
  - If a piece is advanced all the way to the other side of the board, it gains the ability to move backwards.
